    "This notebook facilitates a fixed analysis of static data covering the years 2010 to 2020, designed to ensure consistency and replicability of results across different environments. The choice between data extraction methods is streamlined for efficiency and convenience:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Direct Database Connection**: The notebook attempts to connect to the database at the outset using provided credentials. A successful connection is preferred, especially for conducting the analysis, as it allows direct access to the database. This enables flexibility in querying additional data or making structural adjustments without immediate concern for updating CSV files. The data in the database is static, mirroring the fixed analysis period, and matches exactly the data exported into the CSV files.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **CSV File Access as Fallback**: In cases where the database connection cannot be established (due to incorrect credentials, network access issues, or database unavailability), the notebook automatically switches to using pre-exported CSV files (`student_counts_by_state.csv` and `tech_vocational_expenditures_2010_to_2020.csv`). These files are generated using the same queries as those within the notebook, ensuring that the data and subsequent analysis results will match those obtained directly from the database. This method guarantees that the analysis can be consistently replicated, regardless of the environment setup.\n",
    "\n",
    "The transition between the database and CSV files is handled automatically, eliminating the need for manual configuration. This approach ensures that, whether accessing the database directly or using CSV files, the analysis remains consistent and true to the static dataset from 2010 to 2020."

    "It's essential to acknowledge the limitations of this calculation. The derived \"cost per student\" metric does not account for the nuanced breakdown of expenses directly associated with each student. The analysis lacks the granularity to determine what percentage of funds is genuinely allocated towards the student's educational expenses versus other operational or administrative costs. As a result, the calculated \"cost per student\" serves as an overall indicator and may not accurately represent the true cost of education per student."

    "    - Tech Related Equipment\n",
    "- There is fairly consistent positive growth in Tech Related Equipment between 2015 and 2019.\n",
    "- After 2019, there is a slight decline in this expenditure category. \n",
    "    - It should be noted that COVID-19 started spreading in late 2019, which lead to worldwide pandemic in 2020. \n",

    "#### Summary:  \n",
    "Between 2014 and 2016, there was an 82.64% increase in tech and vocational education related expenditures. Upon further investigation, this increase was driven by the addition of two expenditure categories, `Tech Related Supplies Services` and `Tech Related Equipment`. The main driving factor in the expenditure spike was due to `Tech Related Supplies Services`, which accounted for 18.35% of the total expenditures between 2014 and 2016. Although we see consistent growth in `Teacher Salaries Vocational Edication`, this still accounted for 75.78% of expenditures between 2014 and 2016. After 2016, the sharp spike in expenditures slows, but still maintains a positive trend. `Tech Related Supplies Services` continues to have a greater influence to the overall trend despite the spike in expenditures slowing after 2016.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Noteworthy Event in 2015:\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA)**, enacted in 2015, marked the transition from the **No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB)** and likely impacted educational spending trends. Both **NCLB** and **ESSA** were centered on standards-based education reform, emphasizing accountability and federal funding distribution across various educational domains. However, their primary focus wasn't explicitly geared toward technology and vocational education allocations. Despite lacking specific dedicated funding, their broader influence on education funding, accountability measures, and state discretion might have indirectly affected these areas.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Food for Thought: \n",
    "- There is a steady increase in `Teacher Salaries Vocational Education` over the last decade. Is this change driven by higher teacher salaries, more vocational class offerings resulting in more teachers being hired, or is it a combination of both?\n",
    "- What are the rankings of expenditures by state?\n",
    "- What are the rankings of individual school districts within each state that are driving these trends?\n",
    "- Do student counts per school district/state have any impact on these trends?"

    "#### Summary:  \n",
    "Between 2014 and 2016, there was an 82.64% increase in tech and vocational education related expenditures. Upon further investigation, this increase was driven by the addition of two expenditure categories, `Tech Related Supplies Services` and `Tech Related Equipment`. The main driving factor in the expenditure spike was due to `Tech Related Supplies Services`, which accounted for 18.35% of the total expenditures between 2014 and 2016. Although we see consistent growth in `Teacher Salaries Vocational Edication`, this still accounted for 75.78% of expenditures between 2014 and 2016. After 2016, the sharp spike in expenditures slows, but still maintains a positive trend. `Tech Related Supplies Services` continues to have a greater influence to the overall trend despite the spike in expenditures slowing after 2016.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Noteworthy Event in 2015:\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA)**, enacted in 2015, marked the transition from the **No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB)** and likely impacted educational spending trends. Both **NCLB** and **ESSA** were centered on standards-based education reform, emphasizing accountability and federal funding distribution across various educational domains. However, their primary focus wasn't explicitly geared toward technology and vocational education allocations. Despite lacking specific dedicated funding, their broader influence on education funding, accountability measures, and state discretion might have indirectly affected these areas.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Food for Thought: \n",
    "- There is a steady increase in `Teacher Salaries Vocational Education` over the last decade. Is this change driven by higher teacher salaries, more vocational class offerings resulting in more teachers being hired, or is it a combination of both?\n",
    "- What are the rankings of expenditures by state?\n",
    "- What are the rankings of individual school districts within each state that are driving these trends?\n",
    "- Do student counts per school district/state have any impact on these trends?"

    "The subsequent analysis presents a generalized view of expenditure trends attributed to these specific funding categories. However, it's important to note that while these categories might provide insights into the overall spending patterns, the analysis lacks granularity. We cannot determine the exact amount allocated or spent specifically towards tech/vocational education within each category. Therefore, the trends identified serve as indicators or drivers rather than precise figures for tech/vocational education expenditure."

    "#### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Findings\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Expenditure Trends (2010-2020):**\n",
    "   - Steady growth in tech and vocational education expenditures from 2010 to 2014.\n",
    "   - A sharp increase in expenditures from 2014 to 2016, followed by stabilization.\n",
    "   - Consistent growth throughout the decade, with the most notable spike between 2014 and 2016 (82.64% increase).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Expenditures by Title (2010-2020):**\n",
    "   - Introduction of new expenditure categories in 2015: Tech Related Supplies & Services, and Tech Related Equipment.\n",
    "   - Significant growth in Tech Related Supplies & Services, largely influencing the expenditure trends from 2015 to 2020.\n",
    "   - Teacher Salaries in Vocational Education remained constant, comprising 75.78% of total expenditures between 2014 and 2016.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Impact of Legislative Changes:**\n",
    "   - The enactment of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) in 2015, transitioning from No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB), might have indirectly influenced funding trends.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Additional Considerations:**\n",
    "   - Queries about the increase in Teacher Salaries Vocational Education, the rankings of expenditures by state and district, and the impact of student counts on trends.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Cost Per Student Analysis:**\n",
    "   - A 114.38% increase in cost per student between 2014 and 2016.\n",
    "   - Significant yearly growth in teacher salaries and tech-related categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Student Population Trends:**\n",
    "   - A 0.45% increase in student population from 2010 to 2015, despite a temporary decline in 2012.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Funding Analysis Scope and Limitations:**\n",
    "   - Analysis based on specific federal and state funding sources, lacking granularity in the exact allocation towards tech/vocational education.\n",
    "   - Trends serve as indicators rather than precise figures.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Federal and State Funding Trends:**\n",
    "   - Federal funding: A decrease of 21.23% from 2011 to 2015, followed by an 8.46% increase through 2020.\n",
    "   - State funding: A steady increase from 2010 to 2020, with significant growth after 2014.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Conclusion\n",
    "The analysis reveals a complex and dynamic landscape of tech and vocational education funding in the US from 2010 to 2020. Key highlights include the substantial growth in expenditures, especially post-2014, and the introduction of new expenditure categories. Legislative changes, like the transition to ESSA, and the broader economic and educational context, including the COVID-19 pandemic, have likely influenced these trends. The analysis, while comprehensive, points to the need for further investigation into specific allocations and the impact of different factors on these trends."
